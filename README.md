To make the most of the portrait picker you will need to edit the M_BG.lua and M_nicks.lua files manually with descriptions. This does not need to be done straight away.

If there are any questions, suggestions, or problems, please let me know!

To Install: Just download Portrait Picker v1 .zip and follow the instructions. 

Feel free to use any part of this mod as needed, however please do not distribute it without my permission.
